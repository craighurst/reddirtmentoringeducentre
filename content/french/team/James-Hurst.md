### About Me

My name is James Hurst, and I am currently an Engineering/Arts student at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, and I would love to work with you. I have experience tutoring in any Maths, Japanese, Science or English subjects over a wide range of year levels. Please message me if my profile below interests you.

I graduated as Dux of my high school in 2019, achieving an ATAR of 99.90 (OP 1), and receiving a QCAA Distinguished Academic Achiever Award, given to the top 30 students in Queensland for that year.

I was also awarded the prestigious Tuckwell Scholarship, awarded to the top 25 all-round students who applied to the ANU, Australia's highest ranked university, where I have a GPA of 7.0.

In year 12, I was School Vice-Captain, Chess Captain, in the Senior A Debating Team, 1st XI Cricket Team, and represented Queensland at the UNYouth National Evatt Competition. I was first in Maths B, Physics, Japanese and English at my school in 2019, and in 2018 was first in Maths B and Maths C.
