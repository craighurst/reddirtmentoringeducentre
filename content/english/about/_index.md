### ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

**Red Dirt Mentoring** was born out of the trials of COVID-19. As learning rapidly
moved online, it presented a unique opportunity; geographical location was no
longer a barrier to tutoring! Quickly, our tutors reached out to schools across
the country and now provide tutoring to disadvantaged students, regardless of
location, because we believe a student's future should not be restricted by
where they go to school.
