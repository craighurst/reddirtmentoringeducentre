Our work couldn't be possible without video conferencing technology like Microsoft Teams and Zoom. We do short, 45-minute sessions with students. Two students are mentored by one of our mentors. They are run through some school work, and then our mentors get to know them at the end, providing some life and academic advice.</p>
